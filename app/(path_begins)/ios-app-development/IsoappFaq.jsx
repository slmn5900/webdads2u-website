                                        iOS app development refers to the process of creating applications specifically designed for Apple devices like iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches. These apps are developed using the Swift or Objective-C programming languages and submitted to the App Store for distribution.

                                        <Accordion.Body>
                                        The development timeline depends on the app’s complexity. Simple apps can be built in a few weeks, while complex apps might take several months or even a year.

                                        Once your app is developed, you’ll need to submit it to the App Store for approval. This process involves providing information about your app, screenshots, and app store descriptions.

                                        Before starting development, it’s crucial to define your app’s purpose, target audience, and key features. You should also research similar apps in the market and consider potential monetization strategies.

                                        You can update your iOS app by submitting a new version to the App Store. Updates can fix bugs, add new features, and improve the app’s functionality.
